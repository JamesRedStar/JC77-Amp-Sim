# JC77-Amp-Sim
This is my first git repository so it might seem very messy
But the idea here is that I started this project because I needed something smaller to take with me on tour
There are already tons of amp and cab sims but none of a jazz chorus
So this is why I decided to design and build one myself with only analog components

In this repository, there are documents that contain the KiCad schematic as i've arrived so far, the LTSpice circuit to primarily test the preamp, distortion and cabinet stages but not the chorus stage as there isn't a good enough model of the MN3007 and MN3101 that I intend to use for the chorus circuit.
There is also an LTSpice schematic of a simple MN3007 BBD that I designed by hand which can be useful for other projects if anyone is interested in it.
And a CD4046B library that I found on the internet. I don't remember the source and I feel bad about it but I hope the original owner is happy that I'm using and sharing his design for the greater good.

And if you see anything you like or have some suggestions for me, please hit me up via email.
